A little app in Python for generate password-protected.

The Goal is to generate secured password with many criterias.
The first is to take arguments : the lenth, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbol.
We want a random generation with a algorithm.
The display must show the password in a Python app ( Tkinter ), 
with the indication of the security of the password.
